  <!-- 1966 in6 point -->
  <p>The six points are noted as being:[2]<br>

1.The Constitution should provide for a Federation of Pakistan in its true
 sense based on the Lahore Resolution, and the parliamentary form of 
 government with supremacy of a Legislature directly elected on the basis 
 of universal adult franchise.[1]<br>
2.The federal government should deal with only two subjects: Defence and Foreign
 Affairs, and all other residual subjects should be 
 vested in the federating states.[1]<br>
3.Two separate, but freely convertible currencies for two wings should
 be introduced; or if this is not feasible, there should be one 
 currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions
 should be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East
 to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate Banking Reserve should 
 be established and separate fiscal and monetary 
 policy be adopted for East Pakistan.[1]<br>
4.The power of taxation and revenue collection should be vested in the 
federating units and the federal centre would have no such power. The
 federation would be entitled to a share in the
 state taxes to meet its expenditures.[1]<br>
5.There should be two separate accounts for the foreign exchange
 earnings of the two wings; the foreign exchange requirements of the 
 federal government should be met by the two wings equally or in a 
 ratio to be fixed; indigenous products should move free of duty 
 between the two wings, and the constitution should empower the 
 units to establish trade links with foreign countries.[1]<br>
6.East Pakistan should have a separate military or paramilitary force,
 and Navy headquarters should be in East Pakistan.[1]
